______
**Detail:** [Here](https://github.com/LeHongNgoc3820/Project_Company_Bankruptcy_Prediction/blob/main/Company_Bankruptcy_Prediction.ipynb)

**Conclusions:**

+ The topic uses Machine Learning models to come up with the best model to predict Company Bankruptcy.
+ The best model given is **Logistic Regression Model**. Although ANN has very high accuracy (auc = 92.7%). However, the ANN model is in more implementation and running time, so Logistic Regression is the most optimal choice proposed.
+ Accuracy of model is **92.7%**.
+ **Top 10 Features** that have a big impact on Bankruptcy include:
    + Continuous interest rate (after tax),
    + Persistent EPS in the Last Four Seasons
    + Per Share Net profit before tax (Yuan Â¥)
    + Debt ratio %
    + Net worth/Assets
    + Borrowing dependency
    + Net profit before tax/Paid-in capital
    + Net Income to Total Assets
    + Net Income to Stockholder's Equity
    + Equity to Liability
